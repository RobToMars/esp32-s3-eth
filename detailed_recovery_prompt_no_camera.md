## ESP32-S3-ETH GPIO and Network Control - Detailed Recovery Prompt

I'm working on a modified version of the ESP32-S3-ETH project that has been transformed from a web camera into a GPIO and network control system. This project has several components and specific requirements that need to be understood for effective assistance.

### Hardware Configuration
- **Main Board**: Waveshare ESP32-S3-ETH with Ethernet connectivity
- **Power Options**: USB-C or Power over Ethernet (IEEE 802.3af compliant)
- **GPIO Capabilities**: Digital I/O, Analog Input, PWM output for external components
- **Onboard Components**: RGB NeoPixel LED (WS2812) on pin 38

### Software Architecture
- **Main Sketch**: ESP32-S3-ETH_No_Camera.ino - Core initialization and setup
- **HTTP Server**: app_httpd.cpp - Handles all web requests and API endpoints
- **Web Interface**: Simple HTML/CSS/JS interface embedded in app_httpd.cpp
- **Network Configuration**: network_config.h - Manages Ethernet/IP settings with EEPROM storage
- **NeoPixel Control**: neopixel.h - Controls the onboard RGB LED
- **Pin Definitions**: utilities.h - Defines board-specific pins and constants

### Key Modifications from Original Project
1. All camera-related code and libraries have been completely removed
2. The web interface has been simplified and focused on GPIO and network control
3. PWM functionality has been implemented using standard Arduino analogWrite
4. Network configuration has been enhanced with EEPROM storage for persistence
5. The project structure has been streamlined for better maintainability

### Board Configuration Requirements
- Board: "ESP32S3 Dev Module"
- Flash Mode: "QIO"
- Partition Scheme: "Huge APP (3MB No OTA)"
- PSRAM: "OPI PSRAM"
- These settings are critical for proper operation with the Ethernet interface

### API Structure
The project exposes several RESTful API endpoints:
- GPIO control: /gpio/do?pin=X&state=Y, /gpio/ai/read?pin=X, /gpio/ao/set?pin=X&value=Y
- GPIO overview: /gpio/overview (returns JSON with pin information)
- Network configuration: /network/config/get, /network/config/set?dhcp=X&ip=Y
- NeoPixel control: /neopixel/set?r=X&g=Y&b=Z, /neopixel/off
- System control: /restart

### Safe GPIO Pins
- Digital I/O: 4, 5, 6, 7, 15-21, 35-42, 45, 46
- Analog Input: 1-10
- Avoid pins 9-14 as they're used by the Ethernet interface
- Pin 38 is reserved for the onboard NeoPixel

### Web Interface Features
The web interface provides:
1. Digital output control (set pins HIGH/LOW)
2. Analog input reading
3. PWM (analog output) control
4. NeoPixel RGB color setting
5. Network configuration viewing and editing

### Compilation Requirements
- ESP32 Arduino Core â‰¥3.2.0
- Adafruit NeoPixel library
- EEPROM library (included with ESP32 core)

### Network Configuration System
- Default configuration is stored in network_config.h
- User settings are saved to EEPROM for persistence
- Supports both DHCP and static IP configuration
- Network settings can be changed via web interface or API

### GPIO Control Implementation
- Digital outputs are initialized on first use
- Analog inputs are read directly
- PWM outputs use Arduino's analogWrite function
- All pin operations check against safe pin lists

### Previous Assistance Context
I've already received help with:
1. Removing all camera-related code and libraries from the original project
2. Creating a simplified web interface focused on GPIO control
3. Implementing network configuration with EEPROM storage
4. Adapting the project structure for better maintainability
5. Verifying compilation with Arduino CLI

I need continued assistance with understanding, modifying, and extending this GPIO and network control project without having to re-explain the entire architecture and requirements each time. Please reference this context when providing assistance.
