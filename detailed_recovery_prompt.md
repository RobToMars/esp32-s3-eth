## ESP32-S3-ETH Web Camera Project - Detailed Recovery Prompt

I'm working on an ESP32-S3-ETH Web Camera project that transforms a Waveshare ESP32-S3-ETH board into a versatile web camera with GPIO control capabilities. This project has several components and specific requirements that need to be understood for effective assistance.

### Hardware Configuration
- **Main Board**: Waveshare ESP32-S3-ETH with Ethernet connectivity
- **Camera**: OV2640 camera module connected to the dedicated camera interface
- **Power Options**: USB-C or Power over Ethernet (IEEE 802.3af compliant)
- **GPIO Capabilities**: Digital I/O, Analog Input, PWM output for external components
- **Onboard Components**: RGB NeoPixel LED (WS2812)

### Software Architecture
- **Main Sketch**: ESP32-S3-ETH_2025-04-01.ino - Core initialization and setup
- **HTTP Server**: app_httpd.cpp - Handles all web requests and API endpoints
- **Web Interface**: CameraWeb.html (compressed into camera_index.h) - Browser UI
- **Network Configuration**: network_config.h - Manages Ethernet/IP settings
- **NeoPixel Control**: neopixel.h - Controls the onboard RGB LED
- **Test Suite**: /tests directory with unit and integration tests

### Critical Test Fixes Implemented
The project had several test failures that were fixed by addressing discrepancies between the actual implementation and test expectations:
1. In app_httpd.cpp, pins 6 and 7 are defined as safe pins, but the test mock implementations incorrectly marked them as unsafe
2. The GpioAnalogInput test was failing because it expected pin 6 to be invalid when it's actually valid
3. The GpioMultipleDigitalOutputs test had issues with pin processing count
4. The NetworkConfigIPValidation test had IP validation issues

### Board Configuration Requirements
- Board: "ESP32S3 Dev Module"
- Flash Mode: "QIO"
- Partition Scheme: "Huge APP (3MB No OTA)"
- PSRAM: "OPI PSRAM"
- These settings are critical for proper operation with the camera module

### API Structure
The project exposes several RESTful API endpoints:
- Camera control: /camera/stream, /camera/capture, /camera/control?var=X&val=Y
- GPIO management: /gpio/do?pin=X&state=Y, /gpio/ai/read?pin=X, /gpio/ao/set?pin=X&value=Y
- Network configuration: /network/config/get, /network/config/set?dhcp=X&ip=Y
- NeoPixel control: /neopixel/set?r=X&g=Y&b=Z, /neopixel/off

### Safe GPIO Pins
- Digital I/O: 4, 5, 6, 7, 15-21, 35-42, 45, 46
- Analog Input: 1-10
- Avoid pins 9-14 as they're used by the Ethernet interface

### Compilation Requirements
- ESP32 Arduino Core â‰¥3.2.0
- Adafruit NeoPixel library
- Current compilation stats: 84% program storage (1101278/1310720 bytes), 18% dynamic memory (60800/327680 bytes)

### Web Interface Customization
The web interface can be modified by:
1. Editing CameraWeb.html
2. Running update_zipped_html.py to compress it
3. Recompiling and uploading the code

### Previous Assistance Context
I've already received help with:
1. Analyzing and fixing test failures in the GPIO and network tests
2. Creating a properly packaged Arduino project with timestamp
3. Verifying compilation with Arduino CLI
4. Preparing comprehensive documentation

I need continued assistance with understanding, modifying, and extending this project without having to re-explain the entire architecture and requirements each time. Please reference this context when providing assistance.
